Doom WAD - **W**here's **A**ll the **D**ata

Basically just a list of offsets/size/name8 to file `lumps`.

- mock files for IWAD (internal) `mock-i.wad` and PWAD (patch) `mock-p.wad`
- `tiny.wad` file with no lump
- `mini.wad` with a single dummy lump
- `room.wad` a small square room generated with [Slade](http://slade.mancubus.net/), tested with [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads)
